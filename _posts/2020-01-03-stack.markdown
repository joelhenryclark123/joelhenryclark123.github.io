Stack is a FIFO to do list inspired by the [Paradox of Choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice).

It's pretty barebones. However, it doesn't crash, it adheres to the human interface guidelines, and its useful. Problems solved with this app include, so far:
1. Establishing focus
2. Adding things to your list with minimal distraction

I've actually used this app to manage todos, and it's pretty nice to be able to open the app to a single task. Seeing a whole list is distracting and overwhelming.

Going forward, I'll add features and keep it updated... it's still at the first stage.
