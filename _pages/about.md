In 2009, I started programming with [WarioWare D.I.Y.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare_D.I.Y.) and [LEGO Mindstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms). Shortly afterward, I tried to learn how to make iOS apps. After installing XCode on my hand-me-down computer, I started the intro to the objective-C docs. I ended up frustrated with having to declare variable types, and quickly gave up.

In 2017, I wanted back in the game. So, I enrolled in my university's introduction to computer science course. To prepare, I started teaching myself C++ with [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-C/dp/0321543726). Then, I tried building my own projects. However, I quickly learned that there was a whole lot I didn't know how to do. Instead of giving up like I did the first time, I decided to stick with it.

Now, I build software!
