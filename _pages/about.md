In 2009, I started programming with [WarioWare D.I.Y.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarioWare_D.I.Y.) and [LEGO Mindstorms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms). Hoping to level-up my skills, I tried to learn how to make iOS apps. I installed XCode on my hand-me-down computer, tried reading the objective-C docs, and gave up at the frustration of declaring variable types.

In 2017, I wanted back in the game. So, I enrolled in my university's introduction to computer science course. To prepare, I got XCode installed on my laptop, and started teaching myself C++ with [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-C/dp/0321543726). Then, I tried building my own projects. However, with failure, I quickly learned that there was *so much* I didn't know how to do. Instead of giving up like I did the first time, I decided to stick with it.

Now, I build software!
